The device is completely wireless and contains a custom designed PCB, 1800 mAh lithium polymer battery, 5 vibration motors, an IMU to gather motion data and an FSR to measure armband tightness. All code and hardware models are provided in this repository to replicate the device.

## Software
The software is split into two parts for the client device (the haptic feedback armband) and a master PC that it communicates with. The architecture is shown in the follong Figure.

## Hardware
The armband consists of 5 modules in total. A main module, containing the PCB, battery and senors as well as a vibration motor and smaller modules containing a vibration motor only.
